## 🧱 Imperative Programming

- Focuses on **how** to perform tasks step-by-step.
- Uses statements that change a program's state.
- Examples: Assembly, C, Java (partially)

```c
int x = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  x += i;
}
```

## 🧩 Structured Programming

- A subset of imperative programming.
- Enforces logical structure: sequences, selections (`if/else`), loops.
- Avoids `goto` statements.
- Encourages readability and maintainability.

## 🎯 Key Differences

| Aspect               | Imperative                 | Structured                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Focus                | How tasks are done         | Organizing control flow         |
| `goto` allowed       | Yes                        | No                              |
| Readability          | Can be low                 | Generally high                  |

## 🏁 Conclusion

While all structured code is imperative, not all imperative code is structured. Adopting structured programming leads to better organized, cleaner, and more maintainable code.
